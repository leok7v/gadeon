// The prefill chunk walk. It is a pure function -- a per-row block table in,
// a chunk length out -- and it is where two shipped bugs lived, so it is gated
// here directly rather than through a checkpoint that has to be downloaded
// first. The kernel half of the same contract is MetalSelfTest.checkVisionBlocks.
//
// The invariant that matters is the LAST test: walking a whole turn must cover
// every id exactly once and never cut a block in half. A block's tokens read
// FORWARD across the block, and a key in a later chunk has not been appended
// when an earlier chunk's query runs, so a split block is not slower -- it is
// wrong, and it reads as a fluent wrong answer rather than as a fault.
