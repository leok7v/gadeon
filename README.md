# Gadeon

A pure-Swift chat app that runs GGUF models on Metal and SIMD: the Qwen3.5
and Qwen3.8 hybrids, the ternary Bonsai builds of them, and gemma 4. macOS
and iOS from one codebase, with images, audio and video on the models that
have towers for them.

Pure Swift only: no C, no Python, no FFI. Metal and the system frameworks
are the whole dependency list; nothing runs on the Neural Engine.

## Build

Requirements: an Apple Silicon Mac and Xcode 26 (Swift 6, macOS 15 SDK). The
project also needs two Homebrew tools:

    brew install xcodegen xcode-build-server

`Gadeon.xcodeproj` is NOT committed: it is generated from `project.yml` (the
source of truth) by xcodegen. So build settings live in `project.yml`, not the
Xcode UI, and there are no `project.pbxproj` merge conflicts. Regenerate it
after cloning and after any `project.yml` change:

    xcodegen generate

Then build from the command line, or open `Gadeon.xcodeproj` in Xcode (Run, or
Product > Archive):

    xcodebuild -scheme Gadeon -destination 'platform=macOS' build
    xcodebuild -scheme Gadeon -destination 'generic/platform=iOS' build
    xcodebuild -scheme gadeon -configuration Release build

The last line builds the command-line tool at `Build/Products/Release/gadeon`.
It takes a path to any `.ggxf` file: a chat, `--bench` for the llama-bench
protocol, and the probe and gate modes the engines are gated against.

### Tests

    xcodebuild -scheme Gadeon -destination 'platform=macOS' test

Green with no model on disk: the gates that need weights find a catalog model
in the app's own store, in a Hugging Face clone or under `~/Models`, and skip
by name when none is there.

The app is Apple-Silicon-only (arm64): `Float16` does not exist on Intel, so
`project.yml` excludes `x86_64` (the Mac App Store accepts an
Apple-Silicon-only app).

### Editor tooling (SourceKit-LSP)

`xcode-build-server` writes `buildServer.json` so SourceKit-LSP resolves against
the real Xcode build. Rerun it after generating, then restart the language
server:

    xcode-build-server config -scheme Gadeon -project Gadeon.xcodeproj

## Performance

Throughput on a MacBook Air (M3, 24 GB), Release build, same protocol as
`llama-bench -p 512 -n 128`: a 512-token prefill (`pp512`) then 128 decoded
tokens (`tg128`), reported tokens/sec. Every catalog model, one run each,
2026-09-05, on the Metal backend (`--cpu` opts out to the SIMD engine).

| Qwen3.8-27B-IQ1_S   |    6.63 |    28.7 tok/s |    3.8 tok/s |
| Ternary-Bonsai-27B  |    7.26 |    35.2 tok/s |    4.5 tok/s |
| Qwen3.8-27B-IQ2_XXS |    7.88 |    26.3 tok/s |    3.3 tok/s |
| Qwen3.8-27B-IQ3_XXS |   11.05 |    26.4 tok/s |    2.9 tok/s |
| Qwen3.8-27B-IQ4_XS  |   14.14 |    24.9 tok/s |    2.5 tok/s |
| Qwen3.8-27B-Q4_K_S  |   15.17 |    23.8 tok/s |    2.2 tok/s |

The `-MTP` files carry a drafter and decode with self-speculation, which is
what doubles their `tg128`. Debug builds of the app keep the engine at `-O`,
so the numbers hold there too; see `okf/findings/` for the conditions and
what the matrix says.

Prefill speed is the number that matters most in agentic use: when the model
searches the web, reads a Wikipedia article, or pulls in a news story, every
fetched byte is prompt to ingest, not text to generate. A tool round routinely
prefills 4-16 KB of page text to decode a two-sentence conclusion, so the
reading rate, not the talking rate, bounds how many sources a turn can afford.

## Append-only context, rollback, recurrent state

The hybrid trunk forces a session design that stateless servers never need,
and it is worth being explicit about why.

Three quarters of the layers are Gated DeltaNet: their memory is a fixed-size
recurrent state, a lossy fold of everything ingested so far. Unlike a KV
cache, that state is not addressable by prefix (there is no "reuse the first
N tokens" shortcut), and the only way to recompute it is to replay the entire
conversation through the model. So the engine owns its session state rather
than reconstructing it per request:

- **Append-only continuation.** Each turn renders only the delta (the
  previous stripped answer plus the new user turn) through the model's own chat
  template and appends it to the live state. Nothing is re-prefilled; total
  work over a conversation is O(conversation), and per-turn latency does not
  grow with history. The whole-history re-render plus common-prefix diff (the
  stateless-server pattern) is deliberately absent.
- **Marks and rollback.** Before the generation prompt of every turn the
  engine drops a mark: a deep snapshot of the recurrent state plus the paged
  KV (cheap, since completed KV pages are shared copy-on-write). The next turn
  rewinds to it, which is how transient bytes leave the context: raw
  `<think>` reasoning is dropped and the turn re-appends the stripped answer;
  a tool exchange is re-laid in the template's canonical form instead of the
  model's raw emission. Stop during prefill restores the pre-turn snapshot
  entirely, so the turn never happened.
- **Park / resume / persist.** The same snapshot primitive serializes: whole
  conversations park and resume over one loaded model, and the rendered
  system plus tools prefix is precooked to disk once and restored at launch,
  skipping most of the time-to-first-token.

## Layout

- `LLM/` - the engine: `src/{Base,Qwen,Gemma,Quantize,Slugs,TTS}` (the
  seams, tokenizer, chat template, sampler and ChatSession in Base; a
  lineage per directory; the weight formats; wikipedia search; speech).
- `LLM/metal/` - the Metal kernels both lineages run on.
- `LLM/cli/` - gadeon, the macOS command-line harness for the engine.
- `Chat/` - the session driver and conversation store, no SwiftUI.
- `App/` - SwiftUI app (macOS + iOS), no `#if os` (SDK file split).
- `MD/` - Markdown transcript rendering package.
- `okf/` - the knowledge bundle: what the source cannot tell you.
- `config/platform.xcconfig` - the SDK-scoped source split for the app target.

## Models

The app ships no weights. Model files download on demand from their pinned
Hugging Face commits (`ModelCatalog` + `HubFetch`: sha-pinned, digest-verified,
resumable) into the app's container, once; later launches are offline. A
downloaded file is ready the moment it lands: there is no compile step.

The one cache beside the models is the precooked system prefix under
`~/Library/Caches/<bundle-id>/precook/`, a parked engine state per model and
prompt that a launch restores instead of re-prefilling. Deleting it costs one
prefill per model.

## License

Gadeon is **GPLv3 or later**. That is arithmetic, not preference -- it is the
strongest obligation among the parts it is built from:

| part | source | licence |
|---|---|---|
| speech model + voices | [KittenTTS](https://github.com/KittenML/KittenTTS) by KittenML | Apache-2.0 |

| everything else here | this repo | Copyright (C) 2026 Leo Kuznetsov |

The pronunciation data is copyleft, and eSpeak NG grants **no exception for a
program's output** -- so shipping those files, or a lexicon derived by running
them, carries the same terms rather than escaping them. Apache-2.0 is
one-way compatible with GPLv3 (it may be combined into a GPLv3 work, though
not GPLv2), which is why the result is GPL **v3** specifically and cannot be
anything more permissive.

### Footnote: how the gemma-4-12B repack scores

The 12B GGUF this app downloads is a *recovery* of the quantization-aware
training's own 4-bit codes, not a fresh quantization of the released weights.
Google publishes a second 4-bit build of the same checkpoint, so the two can be
scored against the bf16 they both come from.

Relative weight error against that checkpoint:

| tensor | [ours](https://huggingface.co/leok7v/gemma-4-12b-it-qat) | [w4a16-ct](https://huggingface.co/google/gemma-4-12B-it-qat-w4a16-ct) |
|---|---|---|
| `gate_proj` layer 0 | **1.03e-03** | 6.66e-02 |
| `q_proj` layer 0 | **1.07e-03** | 6.67e-02 |
| `down_proj` layer 30 | **1.10e-03** | 6.66e-02 |

About 65x closer to the trained weights, in a file 6.35 GiB against 9.56 GiB.

Not a better search: the int4 **codes agree 99.40%** between the two files, so
both recover the same trained grid, and Google's build is an independent
witness that the recovery is right. The **scales** differ, theirs a median
1.0645x larger, because a min/max observer takes the block scale from the
block's extreme where this repack refits it by least squares over the settled
codes.

Their build is better on one tensor: it leaves the embedding table in bf16 and
therefore exact, at 1.88 GiB against 0.53 GiB here. Both leave the same modules
unquantized -- the vision patch dense, both multimodal projections and the
position table.

The measurement is reproduced by the converter tooling in the development
repo. Sources:
